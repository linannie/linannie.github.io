		<h2>Mantis</h2>
		<p class="myp">Mantis is a mobile app that identifies colors based off a user-given image. The user would be able to upload or take a picture within the mobile app and select a spot on the picture to generate a specific color name and three color codes in Hex, RGB, and CMYK. In addition, the user would be able to generate a color palette, which produces five additional colors that complement the initial chosen color. Users would be able to save it in a personal color library to keep track of saved colors and palettes chronologically. Within each saved color or palette listing, the user would be able to click on each listing to see information about the color names and color codes.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p class="myp">
        Suppose you were hiking on a Yosemite trail and you encountered a dainty patch of flowers that
was the utmost shade of light purple, but you couldn't really think of a color that best fit the
shade. It wasn't quite a purple shade because it had some pink tones, but it wasn't quite a lavender shade either. You just had to know what the name of the color was in case you'd use it in the near future for a wedding theme or for painting a room, but there was no way to find out. </p>

<p class="myp">This problem also applies to a designer. One of the most important aspects in design projects is to choose a color scheme for the projects. If the designer doesn't choose the right color for the design, it's likely that the design will be unsuccessful. If a designer sees a color they throughout the day, they should be able to identify the color and use it for future designs.</p>

<p class="myp">For these reasons, my friends and I decided to implement a mobile app because of its practicality.The purpose of a mobile app makes the action of taking a picture more efficient. When someone sees a color they want to know, users will able to quickly whip out their phone, snap a picture, and figure out the color.</p>

<p class="myp">We also decided to make sure our color identification provides users with exact information like
color codes, so they would be able to use in their projects or applications. A color
scheme generation is an added bonus we decided to implement because we wanted users to feel
**inspired** for their projects. Then, of course we wanted to implement a way to save favorite colors and color schemes because it would help users keep a stash of favorite colors. </p>
      

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p class="myp">Surveying the app store for related work, we found apps that had the general idea of what we
were trying but were executed poorly. We knew going into this project that we were not trying to
reinvent the wheel, but instead trying to improve it. We believed that Mantis could become a
staple on every phone, while the apps on the app store saw it as more of a novelty.
The pictures below come from two other color identification apps on the app store. </p>

<p class="myp">The one on the left provides minimal information for the user because it only displays the selected color
which does not give the user any other information whatsoever. The app on the right employs
AR to identify live colors, which is innovative but problematic because the color identification square is always moving, so users can't pinpoint a single color due to minute movements from the
hand.</p>
