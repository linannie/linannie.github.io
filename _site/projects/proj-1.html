      <h3>Abstract</h3><br>
      <p>
         Mantis is a mobile app that identifies colors based off a user-given image. The user would be able to upload or take a picture within the mobile app. Then the user would be able to select a spot by tapping on the picture, which would generate a specific color name and three color codes in <a href="#">Hex</a>, <a href="">RGB</a>, and <a href="">CMYK</a>. In addition, the user would be able to generate a color palette, which produces five additional colors that complement the initial chosen color. If the user likes a certain color or palette, they would be able to save it in a personal color library to keep track of saved colors and palettes chronologically. Within each saved color or palette listing, the user would be able to click on each listing to see information about the color names and color codes.</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
      <p>
        Have you ever stopped to ask yourself what color something really was? Have you ever seen a
color and wondered exactly what that shade was?
From a general standpoint, anyone could be curious about a color because it is appealing.
Suppose you were hiking on a Yosemite trail and you encountered a dainty patch of flowers that
was the utmost shade of light purple, but you could not really think of a color that best fit the
shade. It was not quite a purple shade because it had some pink tones, but it was not quite a
lavender shade either. You just had to know what the name of the color was in case you would
use it sometime in the near future possibly for a wedding theme or for painting a room, but there
was no way to find out. This also applies to a designer’s standpoint. One of the most important
aspects for design projects is to choose a color scheme for the projects. Because colors can carry
emotional resonance, the right colors will set a mood for the design and elicit certain emotions
from the audience or consumer. Thus, if the designer does not choose a color that matches well
with the design, it is likely that the design will be unsuccessful. If a designer sees a color he or
she likes throughout the day, he or she should be able to identify the color and use it for future
designs.
From these reasons, we decided to implement a mobile application because of its practicality. A
web application is impractical because it does not make sense for a user to take a picture through
their phone. The purpose of a mobile application makes the action of taking a picture more
efficient. If someone sees a color right away, chances are they would rather take a picture on
their phone, pull out their computer to upload and identify a color. With Mantis, users will able
to quickly whip out their phone and snap a picture.
Then we decided to make sure our color identification provides users with exact information like
color codes, so they would be able to use chosen colors in their projects or applications. A color
scheme generation is an added bonus we decided to implement because we wanted users to feel
inspired and have our app add to ideation for their projects. Then of course we wanted to
implement a way to save favorite colors and palette because it would help users keep track them
for future uses. People are incredible busy nowadays and have so many projects and apps to look
at every day. It becomes more difficult for people to keep track of every single detail, so our
app’s save feature would prevent that.
