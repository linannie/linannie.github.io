title: 'Mantis: A Mobile App for Color Identification'
---

**Abstract**

Mantis is a mobile app that identifies colors based off a user-given image. The user would be able to upload or take a picture within the mobile app. Then the user would be able to select a spot by tapping on the picture, which would generate a specific color name and three color codes in Hex, RGB, and CMYK. In addition, the user would be able to generate a color palette, which produces five additional colors that complement the initial chosen color. If the user likes a certain color or palette, they would be able to save it in a personal color library to keep track of saved colors and palettes chronologically. Within each saved color or palette listing, the user would be able to click on each listing to see information about the color names and color codes.
